# Feature Specification: Customer Master Data REST API

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-new`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a new REST API so that our other systems can integrate and push real-time updates to Customer master data.  Provide Create, Read, Update and Delete operations. Support query by id, company name, contact name, contact email, and phone number"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: Given that the system currently has no authentication mechanism (FR-014), how should external systems be identified and authorized? ‚Üí A: No authentication - open API accessible to any caller
- Q: How should the system handle duplicate customers when the same contact email is submitted multiple times? ‚Üí A: Allow duplicates - multiple customers can share same email
- Q: When searching by company name, contact name, email, or phone number, what matching behavior is expected? ‚Üí A: Partial match (contains), case-insensitive
- Q: When a customer is deleted (FR-010), should the record be permanently removed or marked as deleted but retained? ‚Üí A: Hard delete - permanently remove record from database
- Q: When multiple systems simultaneously update the same customer record, how should conflicts be handled? ‚Üí A: Last write wins - most recent update overwrites previous

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
External systems need to synchronize customer information with the central customer master database in real-time. When customer data changes in a source system (such as CRM, ERP, or e-commerce platform), that system pushes the updated information to the customer master database to maintain a single source of truth. Users of these external systems expect to create new customers, retrieve existing customer information, update customer details, and remove customers that are no longer active.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an external system has a new customer, **When** it sends customer data with company name, contact details, and phone number, **Then** the system creates a new customer record and returns a unique identifier
2. **Given** a customer exists with id "12345", **When** an external system requests customer data by id "12345", **Then** the system returns all customer information including company name, contact name, contact email, and phone number
3. **Given** a customer exists with email "john@example.com", **When** an external system searches by contact email "john@example.com", **Then** the system returns matching customer records
4. **Given** a customer's phone number has changed, **When** an external system updates the customer record with the new phone number, **Then** the system persists the change and confirms the update
5. **Given** a customer is no longer active, **When** an external system requests deletion of that customer, **Then** the system removes the customer record and confirms deletion
6. **Given** multiple customers exist with company name "Acme Corp", **When** an external system searches by company name "Acme Corp", **Then** the system returns all matching customer records

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle requests to retrieve a customer that doesn't exist?
- What happens when an external system tries to update a customer that has been deleted?
- How does the system respond when required fields are missing in create or update requests?
- How does the system handle malformed or invalid data in customer fields?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept customer creation requests from any external system (no authentication required)
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate all required customer fields (company name, contact name, contact email, phone number) before creating a record
- **FR-003**: System MUST assign a unique identifier to each new customer record
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow retrieval of customer records by unique identifier
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow retrieval of customer records by company name
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow retrieval of customer records by contact name
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow retrieval of customer records by contact email
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow retrieval of customer records by phone number
- **FR-009**: System MUST support updating any customer field for existing records
- **FR-010**: System MUST support permanent deletion of customer records (hard delete)
- **FR-011**: System MUST return appropriate error messages when requested customer does not exist
- **FR-012**: System MUST return appropriate error messages when required fields are missing or invalid
- **FR-013**: System MUST persist all customer data changes immediately
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow multiple customer records with the same contact email (duplicates permitted)
- **FR-016**: System MUST support partial match (contains) search for company name, contact name, contact email, and phone number fields, case-insensitive
- **FR-018**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: audit trail requirement - log who created/updated/deleted records and when?]
- **FR-019**: System MUST use last-write-wins strategy for concurrent updates (most recent update overwrites previous changes)
- **FR-020**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data validation rules - phone number format, email format validation strictness?]
- **FR-021**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pagination for search results - limit number of returned records?]
- **FR-022**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: response time requirements - maximum acceptable latency for read/write operations?]
- **FR-023**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rate limiting for external systems - maximum requests per time period?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Customer**: Represents a business customer in the master database. Contains customer ID (5-character identifier), company name, contact person details (name and title), full address information (address, city, region, postal code, country), communication details (phone, fax, email), and metadata (creation/update timestamps).
